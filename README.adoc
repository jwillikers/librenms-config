My configuration for {LibreNMS}, a network management and monitoring tool.

== Usage

This repository contains the configuration files for {LibreNMS}.
The configuration is meant to be used with the containers from the https://github.com/jwillikers/home-lab-helm[Home Lab Helm] repository.

. Create a `Projects` directory in the current user's home directory.
+
[,sh]
----
mkdir --parents ~/Projects
----

. Clone this repository under `~/Projects`.
+
[,sh]
----
git -C ~/Projects clone git@github.com:jwillikers/librenms-config.git
----

. For each template file in the `config` directory, copy it to the same directory without the `.template` extension.
+
Bash::
+
[,sh]
----
for host_template in config/*.yaml.template; do cp --no-clobber -- "$host_template" config/$(basename -- "$host_template" ".template"); done
----

fish::
+
[,sh]
----
for host_template in config/*.conf.template; cp --no-clobber -- "$host_template" config/(basename -- "$host_template" ".template"); end
----

Nushell::
+
[,sh]
----
for host_template in (glob "config/*.conf.template") { cp --no-clobber $host_template $"($host_template | path parse | reject extension | path join)" }
----

. Fill in any missing credentials in the files in the `config` directory, such as SNMPv3 authentication and encryption keys.

. Make sure that the sensitive files are not world readable.
+
[,sh]
----
chmod 0660 config/*.yaml
----

. Determine the UID mappings inside the rootless user's namespace.
+
[,sh]
----
podman unshare cat /proc/self/uid_map
         0        818          1
         1     655360      65536
----

. Do the math to determine the UID outside of the container that is used for user inside the container.
In this case, the container defaults to UID 0 inside the container.
From the output of the previous command, we can see that UID 1 maps to UID 655360.
The following expression yields the UID outside of the container.
+
[,sh]
----
math 655360 + 0 - 1
655359
----

. Make sure that files are owned by the subuid that will map to the `root` user in the container.
+
[,sh]
----
sudo chown --recursive 655359 config
----

. Then mount the provided `config/` directory inside the LibreNMS server container at `/data/config`.
